# Foundation: Introduction to LangGraph

---

## Module 0:

There wasn't much to learn as everything had been covered before.

Set API keys and loaded the .env file. Also instantiated two models and used **.invoke()** and **.stream()** to pass HumanMessage as a string and get AIMessage as output.

*Changes made:*

Changed and added new prompts.

## Module 1:

### Video 1: Motivation

Learned that **Chains** are fixed control flows set by the developer, and an A**gent** controls the flow defined by an LLM. As more control is given to the agent, the application's reliabilty decreases. **LangGraph** is used to increase this reliability.

*Changes made:*

There wasn't any code so no changes had to be made.
